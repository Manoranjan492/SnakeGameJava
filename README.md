<h3>About:-</h3>
<p>1.Snake Game is a classic arcade-style video game that originated in the 1970s and has since become one of the most iconic and recognizable games in the history of gaming. The game's concept is simple yet highly addictive, making it a favorite among players of all ages.</p>

<p>2.In the Snake Game, players control a snake-like creature that moves around a bordered playing area, often resembling a grid or maze. The objective of the game is to guide the snake to eat food items, typically represented by dots or small icons, which appear randomly on the screen. As the snake consumes these food items, it grows longer in length.</p>

<p>3.The challenge arises from the fact that the snake's movement is continuous and cannot be stopped. Players can control the direction in which the snake moves, typically using arrow keys or other directional inputs. The snake moves at a constant speed in the direction it's facing, and it will continue moving until it hits a wall or its own body.</p>

<p>4.The game becomes progressively more difficult as the snake grows longer. Maneuvering around the playing area becomes increasingly challenging due to the snake's extended length, and players must avoid colliding with the walls or the snake's own body. Colliding with any obstacle ends the game, and the player's objective is to achieve the highest possible score before that happens.</p>

<p>5.As the snake grows longer, players need to plan their movements carefully to avoid creating situations where the snake collides with itself. This adds a strategic element to the game, as players must anticipate the consequences of their movements several steps ahead.</p>
<p>6.The Snake Game's simple mechanics, combined with its challenging and strategic gameplay, have made it a staple on a wide range of platforms, from early arcade machines to modern smartphones. Over the years, the game has seen numerous adaptations and variations, each adding unique twists and features while maintaining the core concept of guiding a growing snake to consume food and avoid obstacles.
